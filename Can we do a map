Day in the life of a normal prisoner v. solitary 

Can we do a map?
	probably not a rich enough data source

Cost
	monetary
	social

Not achieving attended goal
	after 20 years, who comes out?

Has there been a change over time?

Profit v Non profit

Is there any due process?

What makes an interesting story?
	Interesting characters
	Change how you think about the issue

Can we/how do we humanize or understand prison guards

Hard to even count the number of solitary confinement, some leads on possible data sets:

	Number in supermax
	Number in 'restricted housing'
	'Administrative segregation'

focus on juveniles?

NYCLU lawsuit

Cali lawsuit might have stats associated with it

Bureau of Justice Statistics does a prison census every 5 years; I think the the results are hosted on this site:

but internet broke before I had a chance to see exactly what is available.
