NYC Angular 9.17.2013

Requirements
	Storing and delivering IP

	Awesome UI

	Modular Design

Started w/ a google doc
	no control over content
	6 months
	300 students
	500k

"jj"
	SPA learning platform
	transforms xml into html

	load page + angular
	pull down curri in xml over ajax
	match xml tages w/ directives of the same now
	css styling!


Directives
	extend vocab of html
	<li ng-repeat>

	can't do dynamic directives w/ angular - have to define all of the directives ahead of time

	can change name of of tag from ol to li really easily!


Backend
	flask
	SQLAlchemy
	PostgresSQL
	git submodules

Wrap up
	Decoupled styling tools
		xml -> html -> css
		wasn't hard to iterate on design changes!
		confidnet we can throw front end away

	Makes it easy to add chat

	.complile() w/ nested diresectives made a mess
		some of the directives are 'compondand'
		when you render the assignment tag, you put a compile tag in, to go through dom and show it
		solution:
			don't compile anything inside directives
			instead, slightly inequalgnetly: compile inside the controller

Text editor for editors
	nope!
	thought about wordpress, better admin tools

	could you turn html back into angular?
		ehhhhhhhh you add so much junk to the html so it is nicely designed
		systamatically doing it also generates more verbose html

Other alternetive approuches besides xml
	render
		could just do curriculum writters write html
		maybe a more flexable UI
		can't really test w/ server side, way to much going over all files
		espically since each document has multiple verison

		json would basically end up being the same, xml is more human readable

		database might work, but then you need an admin interface
	store

No flicker, nothing shown till page loads all the way

SEO problem?
	cornerstone problem of an SPA
	when google curls the page, it doesn't find anything because anglular adds everything

	we avoid that problem! our page is private... and public ones are static

	maybe do rewrite rules for bots, put up static page
		how do you test it
		seems pretty painful maybe?

	html snapshot!

	Two solutions
		phantomjs
			when headless browser shows up, render client stuff server side 

		brombone - does phantom for you as a service

how do images work?
	put link or image in w/ just <a> just gets pushed in

	no images yet! just get served as a static image

	videos? same problem, haven't approuched that

	maybe route on the server that delvers static files
		more of an issue for IP and verisoning system

loss of flexability for designers?
	using paritals in the template




how to resolve multiple http request before starting controller?
	resolve - special property that require all the requests return w/ promises
	instead of creating a service, create a resolve

	the nice result of that - the contructor no longer does http and you don't have to mock out a backend call


I have a service that is keeping track of an object
I need to the scope to rerender as the scope progresses 
or are services not meant to be used w/ scope digest
	you manage to get into service w/o an apply
	the only way you can get out of an apply is w/ a setTimeout...
	the events you're getting back need to be wrapped in root scope apply

two directives, on contained within the other
scope varible contained 
what we need to access isn't the parent element
but it is a json object w/ nested elements
how can the child element access other children w/o controller through partent?
	inject parent through the child directive
	i'm not sure where the json objects
	if it lives in controller, you'll need it

	the general idea scope isn't a scratch pad where you put things
	just for the UI
	controllers should write and not read from the scope


trying to use UI tooltip built w/ bootstrap
data attribute doesn't get complied
	not familuar w/ angularUI, which is a 3rd party thing...
	data-x is a prefix that we useually strip out

with in scope you can access element and 
????
	use $(element).data

future of angular & SEO
will this be addressed?
will google support it?
	need to solve in the core of the framework was diminished

is ???
	we want the community more involved
	chop up angular into smaller pieces
	the hope is that when we do that it'll be like node
	routing is pretty complicated!
		we designed w/ simplacy
		hopefully the community will expand it
		third parties will be able to try out some things


what resources do you recommend for learning
	i don't really read them lol
	john from mendad (???) io

how much javascript do you need to know to use angular
just use dart instead?
	coffee script, type script works just fine - anything that semantically compiles to angular

	we are building a parell angular with dart
		method.dispatch v. method.invoke
		+ means different things
		so we have to build seperately

LIGHTING ROUND

	reusable compontents

	data bindings are shared between chart, map and html elements
		angular was great for this!
		lots of watches
		directives are natutural way to work with this

		army num bound to frame
			on watch, on scope change 

	ggtracker



	made charts with divs css and ng repeat (!!!!!!)

	slider breaks with ipad w/ webview outside of saferic

	3d transorms do some nice transictions6
