	Start with design

	Non-traditional design patterns

	Design that explores -> not communicate

		felt shallow 

	
	Analysied the data with the same tool that I created

	No authoritive tone like that of typical data paper

	
	Bret Victor - active readership


	Design is a search space


	media companies ae CRUSHING IT (go blacki)
