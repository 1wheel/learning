Intro
    open source front end framework developed by twitter
    collection of html templactes, css, and jquery

Why
    if you're not a front end dev
    time/resource constraints
    prototyping

Core features
    grid layout
        page layout strategy using css
        proving structure to the web content in form of columsn and rows
        really easy to implement a grid system
        intutive naming scheme, you just start codding it

Ember - Into the Flames

prior to 2006, jquery came out which made front end web dev way eaiser

Then the web got into the a rut... people mostly replicated w/ lens flair

Really hard to make an app like experence - on the web, have to be google w/ million dev hours to make gmail front end

What makes ember awesome
    bindings

Not to build normal websites... to enable app like expereince
    you can 

embr
jquery
handlebars

ember applications 
    templates
    components
    router - routes
        help you maintain state in your application
    models 
        stores persisent state
        number of visits, number of emails etc
    controllers

v angular?
    ember doesn't allow you to shoot yourself in the foot

v backbone
    not an mvc framework
    no databinding

v knockout
    ???

ember: intented for -applications-, i want to interact w/ my data in an interesting way. 

docs? suggested resources?
    rely too much on video..
    angular docs are better
        lol no

How to learn from code

about
    learning process
    find out stuff underhood

which
    backbone, backbone, underscore, jquery

what i made:
function Collection() {}
    array like object

jquery - dom maniupluation libeary + other tools
    my lib doesn't do anything with the dom

    no conflict

    length

    constructor facade
        don't protect from people who don't use new

backbone
    on && trigger
        w/ object.observe

    json

underscore
    highly functional, enjoyable read
    zip

angular
    huge performance hit when you use apply
        using 10 args instead of 1... results in ~40% 

mocha
    testing for javascript

should.js
    descripives, getters, and setters
