GeoNYC 9/9/13

	Mapping for WalkNYC
		T-Carter
			Providing a wayfinding system for ny dot

		London
			Doing it for over 10 years
			Devopling modal information
				Buses said stuff about buses
				trains said stuff about bikes
				no maps for bikes

			Need people to walk more
				subway trips w/ one or two stops all the time
				want fewer cars w/ congessition feeds
				buses don't have tickets sold withing
				people need more information

			1000s of info points over london
				densiest in the middle, more on the periphary

			Cycle superhighways
				bike paths from the out, in
				less intersection w/ traffic

			we combined graphic design and catrography element
				mostly paper products on the street
				some digitial products too


		New York
			Bloomber created more public spaces, way eaiser to walk around now
				eaiser to bike and walk

			Brought over to do simerlar work
				production and design effort - 'interesting process'

			Faceup/heads up map are much more understandble then north up maps

			simple/predictable/relevant

			use the mta icongraphy as a starting point
			hevitica as a font

			sources
				do-it data form the city

			standards
				layers, apperence
				large scale, locator 1/500
				overview 1/10000 for biking

			by 2014 should have whole city mapped out by teams (only lower manhattan done now)

			a couple signs up around china town now

			very rectanglular signs
				opposite sides show different information, what you're facing

			data set covered by open data law, not released to entire delivery

			automated label placement
				database allowes overlap
				graphic artist goes over eachone and does some finishing work by hand
					highly automated, font sizes correctly position is close
					layout walk speed circles by hand

		the future!
			other places - philly

		why is the land vacent?
			urban renew in the 60s/70s; vacent for half a century unexsucablity
			market hasn't gotten there yet

		doing jobs in other cities for grants, that pays our rent

		wish list of vacent lots?

		why is the lot data not updated?
			wish i had insight into how this data was constructed
			in chicago they have some on github...
			there needs to be feedback loop
			bring up at beta
