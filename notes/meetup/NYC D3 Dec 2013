Visualizing NP Complete Problems

Polina Viro

Class of problems
	polynomial time to check solution
	super polynomial time to solve

	examples
		traveling salesmen
		nap stack

hard to explain with words/use d3!
	where is the data?

generate the data
	np-food


  window.setTimeout(function() {
    var c = d3.select($('.close-cost')[0]); 
    c.on('click')(c[0][0]);
  }, nodes.length < 15 ? 1500 : 5500);

  saveImg();
better way of doing this


d3 & ufora

	fora really great for parallel computing

	it does parallelism for you!
		unroll forloops just like magic

	runs on clusters
		distrubutes work and data w/o you having to think about it

	once we have a browser based ide... why not put d3 into the browser

	on github/ufora


gender map

	@pauldechov

	d3 + ember

	custom layout


	switch to canvas if you have too many elements

	STAGGERED DELAY

	css transitions are faster when you have 500 elements, goes faster

	numeric tweenz
