Calming Data Skeptics
	Mike Schoeffler

	Why so curious?
		people are smart

		they occupy their minds while you talk by finding problems w/ what you've done

		lots of ways of doing something wrong, they don't know you haven't screwed up

		think of them as doing you a favor, stop you from making bad recommendations

	Become your own data skeptic
		devolp some sort of proof

		eaisly understood

		indepentent data
			different time period

		addresses problem

	Demonstration

	Statistical confience
