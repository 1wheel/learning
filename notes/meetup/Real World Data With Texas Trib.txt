Real World Data

Miranda 

travis swicegood
	texas tribune
	lead dev on content thing?
	many years!

how you deal with it!
	
well what it is
	not big data
		two seperate problems
		more civic based, generated by governments
		maybe a few million records? not constantly growing

		traffic data might be big data, but not acciscable to us probs
			maybe other live things?
			census data can also be pretty big

		fb or twitter does big data w/ petabyes every day

	dirty
		someone entered -> mistakes are made
		not just interacting machine to machines
		humans entering zip codes wil make typos

	-> unpredictable!
		making a bill tracker, parell to open sunlight
		built scraper, felt confident that it would work next year
		authors, sponsers, just built from text field
		dealt with special cases - two patrics

		janary 9th errors on the scrapper
			unknown patric? overnight someone had decided patrick, dan
			was now patric

	limited
		always gonna have to combine mulitple sources to get what you want
		unique legistlative ID (which isn't exposed on bills site)

	never exactly what you need
		have to tweak somethings
		make some assumation

	unpleasent
		don't be scared plz

	constrained
		quantifiable
			150 reps
			31 senators
			254 counties
		we can verify against and check

	really interesting!
		effects peopls lives 
		you can tell a story

Strategies
	script everything
		SERIOUSLY
		so you can reproduce it
		not just for your sucessor - but for you in 3 months
		self docs
		5 min of work, so simple... but way harder to reconstruct

	keep copies
		data disappears
		stuff doesn't live at the same URL forever, gov websites

	know your source
		know where the data is coming from
			try to understand private source motivation
			and same for gov agency... maybe not telling whole story?
		talk to the people! 
			build relationship
			get pointers from them

	know what human's touched
		is this someone reading handwritting
		has someone done some other manipluation
		above step here helps a lot!

	know everything
		immerse yourself in the data
		some things have a quick turnaround in week...
		others we spend a month on. try to find out everyhing you can
		'these all look like numbers' well maybe they have codes in them

		is there a common way of calculating the number of students at a univeity?
		NO! fed and states have different formulas
			how did you decide whose to you?
			we pass the buck whenever we can! say an expert did it
			privacy concerns;
			can't say 3 ethnic people, just 0+ -> adding breakdowns doesn't sum to totals

			judgement call - made more sense to use the texas data
			since that's our focus and what the legilator would be looking at
			nice to have two! private schools don't report to texas
			that needs to be called out w/ astrisk

			editoral will make those judgement calls (morgan smith)
				let subject matter expert deal with that
			team:
				tech people
				designer
				at least one editorial person
					'these are the things which might interesting'
				a crossfilter!
					8 different metrics of public schools
					investigate outliers!
					cash strapped schools put all their engery to passing state scores. 

			how are editorial staff incorerated?
				walk over to desk and say hi?
				trying to get people to come over to basecamp
				hard to get them comfortable coming over to us
				'them' 'us' culteral shift
				journalist writters/programmers just do that...

	document everything
		have to explain things you've found out
		narritive doc?
		lessons learned readme
		literate programming with comments explaining?
		docco!

	embrace change
		things will be change! be prepared
		write flex points in code, write code defensily so you can swap out scrapping functions 
			code might seem more complicated then it needs be but you need it

tools
	git
		(or any verison control)
		great for csvs! you can see where it changes
		new stuff added (did things change??!?!)

	csvkit

	tabula
		gov data is all pdfs
			export csv from them??!
			support from command line

	unix philospophy
		write programs that do one thing well
		and work well togeather
		with text streams

		not just a big for loop! not flexiable..

	python	
		NumPy
		pandas, stats. find the outliers

	R
		don't use much, very powerful
		jase davis, using R to interate data
		nycar talk

	chrome web tools
		inject jquery
		network tab

	jQuery -> pyQuery
		'what selector can i use to get the data'
		try it in the browser
		
	http proxies
		charles proxy
		glimmer blocker
		record, replay

		access mobile data api
			reverse enginer api..

	openRefine
		create rules around normalizing data
		map texas ass. of relator, tx aor, ect to same name
		command line tools, gui

	overview
		search for knight, aspress, 
		AND filter through stuff!
		takes text docs and helps you process them
		wtf does that mean?
		maybe their will be a scandle! haven't gotten to use yet

	data stores
		couchDB
			overkill?
		mongoDB
			just throw json
		postgres/postGIS
			need valid reason to move off of
			no reason to move
			just start with something tradional, migrate if you have to

usecases
	public school explorer
		8 different sources of data
		single page for every public and private hs k-12
		70 million rows of data
		1 data source have 700 columns?
		12 steps to import
			AA program?
			haven't automated everything... just have done twices

	state employee salaries database
		it is a bear!
		141 different source
		every department
		every university system
		they don't give state entire budgets, we have someone who collects the data
		still automating? process of getting all the departments the same is a nightmare

	state prisoners
		have historical data, not exposed
		1 source!!! dept. of criminal justice
		on auto pilot
		copy data off of dvd, run a few scripts, everything is updated

	reservoir map
		some are at only at 7%
		lake travis at 40%
		get json data from the state! (built relationships)
		stuff people want to do, but they don't have time or ability

how is data shared with people in the newsroom?
	working to provide reporters with real apis; not just snapshots

what is the texas trib?
	non profit policy and politics
	we cover texas
	
	npr style
	events, coperate sponerships, membership

	matt styles drove a lot of the focus on the data
		-I- say we're a tech company that produces journalism

	company has about 40 people
		4 of us who program exclusivly
		tech and ed is about half
		rest is support around that

	does non profit change things?
		gives us a reason to make open source
		if you're saying 'your content platform gives me an edge'
			'my word processor sets me apart'

	was it weird publishing lotto data after austin statesmen data?
		lots of people still don't know what ot make of us
		'no scalable' 'unicorn'
		just keep doing good work, maybe we'll be emulated

	do you think have a model that is tranferable?
		we just got a grant from the knight foundation to have a fellow
		just look at what the texas trib does
		and another to document what we do 
		the result will be a 'howto'

		'we are they boy who lived' chicago news co-opt, basis in SF
		maybe just unique situation in texas, big state, lots of money
		big federal impact too! 
		still even if you can't replicate everything, you can find good ideas

	who was the starting group? k of chi copt was just trib people..
		even smith
		jon dornton, partener at austin ventures. lots of money
		matt style from houstin chronical
		emily ransaw from dallas morning new
		criminal justice from el paso times

	if you're in the black, are you hiring??!?
		if it was up to me!

	how do you approch gov agencies/build relationships? 
		hard to get to the write person
		which is a lot of work in itself
		got an introduction from managing editor

		ask, understand.
		is there someone else who i should be talking to?

		litmus test when asking to someone.. is this a temp or a burcrat that knows the system. standard navigating messes

	are you working to standardize data? guardian was working on it
	idk when or if that will happen here
		our focus is just on texas mostly
		bigger standardization? really thorny problem... need something above us.
		barly have time to do things right, much less standizie for 50 times

	do you build APIs?
		not trottling or anything, so you can take it if you want?
		we do get requests, not planning on exposing more maybe?
		no guarteen it'll be their tomorrow

	why don't you sell the API?
		we've talked about it... sort of changes the dynamic of what we are doing
