webgl @philogb
	
	what is webgl
		api to access gpu

		france mobiliy
			40000 counties - web gl can actually handle

		wind patterns
			binary array buffer to combpress data
			dump data in and explore without lag

		surface explorer	
			mac calc, uses loop to show parameterization

		temperatue anomalise


		realtime data analysis

			color decomposition
				use transperent shape to prevent ocuculsion

		story telling
			ian machlin - eye catching, imendly isnteresting

		scientfic viz
			line intergral convultions
				build to use the gpu, no lag
				show fields

		data art
			twitter revine loops
				fractual space filling algorthism
				only possible with webgl


	webgl api
		js api store an array of floats in a buffer that can be access by the gpu

		glsl api - pipeline of processes that gets handled by the gpu
			vertex shader
				1 to 1 mapping between input and output points
				programable

			fragment shader
				looks at more than one point

			
			vertex shader

			triangle assubly
				not programable, tranforams points into faces

			rasterization
				3d shapes get translated into picutes

			fragment shader



			glsl - dsl for graphics
				c-ish
				build in types for graphics - vectors, matrics, 
				build in functions for graphics - reflect
				operator overload! 



			hopf fibration
				explore 4-d shapes by projecting into 3d
				sterographic project preservers spheres across dimension projection

				instanced arrays

				fibers view

				interactions
					everything renders effeintly, can't click on anything

				hover only gives you color
					each pixes maps to a unique color
					decode color position


	uses gpu - million+ object, fast

	low level - use threejs, philogl, stackjs

	opencl, diferent spec



mapping the cosmos
  


nigel homes - humor
	chartjunk!

	contex matters!

	CONTEX

	no permission given to tuffte - not bitter about it

	in print, a magizing, a galler, interacting on a computer

	contect by making people smile

	friendly, approchable

	humor, good humor, good feelings and emotions

	emotions v intellect


	data visualizers v inforgraphics

	editing, not simplifying but clarifying

	don't show everything!

	design differently for different medium

	don't be seducded by new tech - mozart wrote bad music for the harmonic




the human side being a digitla practitor
	our tools are soo utitrain - why?

	expression v. utility

	our tools are expressive and have interntions


	visual music - emtionally distill what 
		cell drawing animations is so tedious

	augmented - like tween js

	two-js renders to webjl,svg, canvas.
		very processing like


	why make a tool?
		learning
		community
		reusabilty




blindfolded cartography - bostography
	axis maps: interactive web maps

	designin interactive maps for data you can't see yet

	traditional cartography allows for perfectionism

	tale of compromises

	classifcation
		john nelson - don't lie with data

		distriubtions in design v. reality

		will the map  be useful and look good
		will the chrt be useful and look good
		are the breaks meaningful
			if you're mapping income, maybe show a break at the poverty line
			diverging, show a break at the mid point
		are the breaks understandable
			std dev isn't intutufi
		are the breaks pretty numbers

		jenks naturla breaks

		quantile breaks
			guardiness spread of colors

		use percentiles

		percentiles based on unique values



	density
		circles overlap - sort by size


	handling missing years


	text
		max height and overflow auto

		thoughtfull about how you abrivate - maybe last digit is most signifiengt

		mind your number formating 
			plural
			spacing

			1000 thosound ? just say 1 million
				axis and scale ticks are nice!


  lorem ipsum map
  	roth and harrower can be quire determential

  	map design doesn't match UI, looks ugly

  	bad fake data can also text your code

  	smart dummy data - carolyn fish
  		use OSM to stand in for more complete but inaccessible data





  kosara - storytelling and data
  	why
  		stories are all around us
  		we are really good with them


	    stories make you pay attenetion

	    memomery, stickyness
	    	how do you tell parts of stories to market

	    not for exploration or analysis, but communtication
	    when you want to change people's minds

	    like velco, just more hooks
	    	you have to remember to remember something else
	    	stories are those pieces of connected tissues



    how
    	techniques
    		connected satter plot
	    		transforms from sparse set of circles
	    		to a story that you read over time with annoations

	      isotypes
	      	turn firgures into stories and remember them better than bars


	  neil coh, visual narrative structutre; cognitive side of comics
	  	eipr


	  scrolling isn't great, thinks are demeractied like steps so we struggle to remember (what?)


	  oh man, everyone rememebers who the women in the story was
	  zeigarnik effect - we rememeber things that are unfinished
	  	waiters remembered orders very well, until they were payed, then they forgot




Lichen
	visual programming to encorage collaberation with non programmers

	show predictive model, client side js




calderwood

emobied viewing
	visual processing

	loops, cycles

	storytelling
