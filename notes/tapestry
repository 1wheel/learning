# Who invented data journalism scott klien

- 538
- detroit free press analysis of riotered
- keeping tracking of pestlance, before news papers - tracking the rise of the plague
- stamform mecurcy. oldest news paper - commedies prices on the fron the page, shipping news. lloyds list 
- penn gazzette, published 'join or die' and shipping news/prices
- 1788 election results 

wood blocks to set in type
  - bombay times 1842 - publishes line cahrt
  - napolian graphic of invansion shaips

Engraving
  - harpers

  - sometimes copper
  - penny press (new york daily trib) giant graphic on front page 1844
  - 1849 line chart, needed very careful annoation descscinb
  - civil war boom for battle maps. engraving companies formed to make these
  - transatalnic cable map
  - 1890 first weather isoline

  lot of copying between papers in different cities

photogravier

  - lights
  - spotlights

how did you reserch
  - search for 'above chart' 'below chart' 'diagram showing'. digital news paper archives
  - no standard names - 'statical curves' or 'statical course'

AP election results
  - since 1850s
  - pay people to call up local results and report
  - got it wrong in 1910

Really hard to find who 

Did papers draw from playfair
  - probably not independent discovery
  - lots of stats societies 
  - much more arthimatic then regressions
  - spent decades thinking about the rules around graphics, huge beurcay about what is a good chart
  - french started doing it really well in 1860s outside of that frame work

did people learn to read more charts?
  - professor galbskey's help mentioned
  - annontations start to disappear
  - civil war maps were ubiboues

what is technology enabling that wasn't possible in the past
  - interactivity
  - programmers that are interested in journalism
  - line charts were new at one points; suggests we can create new forms that will be intutive

we've become more 'objective'
  - rise of objectivy in news
  - commuters? 
  - TKTK book about this? divcovery of the news

majority of our datasets our from the gov
  - not public
  - website scraping
  - FOIA



# Power of drawing in visual storytelling

  dear data, data chain


drawing the verb, not the noun

people are uncomfortable drawing their ideas


power of drawing (verg)
  clarity
    elinates distractions

    map your mind
      grow it from there
      don't go to google! stop when the page is full

    chart your ideas
      produce more and more ideas
      most are bad

    add depth


  collaboration
    if you present something polished, people see flaws not potiential

  creativity








# Compenent Crictic - Alan Smith

Before and after dressing show

exhibt A
show the process of transformation

Thinking text plus
  what why

exhibit B
  don't just fill space

exhibit C
  same data new light





# pulling the curtain back on data viz




# selfie data

other people's data is like vaction phots




# plural of annodate

proxy data

  party affilation -> vote choice
  whole food or cracker barrel -> demographics, call

corroboration
  overlaying small datasets can show better info

Creation  

  pulling data out of thin air

  sentimentn analysis on nyt headlines

Supplementation

  

story could be lack of data








# start with a congnitive challege about data

how to understand scales of measurement or jargon
  look at cognitive phys
  look at storytellers, data journalists, designers, science journalists


unfamilar measures
  concreate scales
    takes a lot of work to create a measurement anlogy
    have to know what our audince things is familar

  can we automatallicy generate these?
    what makes a good analogy

    good objects
      familyar
      concrete
      countable
      low variance

    how do we represent these objects in a database
      wordnet, a semantic network
      focus on afticaf - man made object taken as a whole
      quearied for pyshical properties
        amazon, DBpedia
      mturk to find if it familar

    keeping number sense below 10 is important

    spatial and areas work better with located landmarks
      scrape yelp
      figure out how known they are based on flikr tags



make sense of many visualizations at once
  what makes a good sequence for a set of visualzations
  are some sequences better than others?
  sequences control the stories we construct in our heads

  most of infoviz research is about sequence of research NOT presention

  examained 400+ transitions in order viz

  temmpol sequence
  dimension walks
  measure walks
  hieracry based

  are these 'fundmental'

  minimze cognitive cost

  don't do lots

  pref order temporal > (dim|measure) > hieracrhcy

  writing and using parrell struture 

  semantic groupings

  low level model doesn't work for repeated transitions



use narritive tools for analysis
  recommend views to analysist
